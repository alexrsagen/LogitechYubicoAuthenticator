# Yubico Authenticator for Logitech G13/G15 LCD
This application will let you generate HOTP/TOTP codes and display them on a Logitech G13/G15 LCD.

Also contains a useful C# port of the Yubico OATH protocol and CCID driver under the YubicoCCID project. Uses [pcsc-sharp](https://github.com/danm-de/pcsc-sharp/) for PCSC communication with the YubiKey.
